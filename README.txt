Sort File

Sort.h, Sort.cpp, main.cpp, Makefile, README.txt are all of the documents for the sort file.

This program takes the method choice from the user and determines which of the three sorting methods to execute on the array list created.  It throws an exception if the user inputs a bad choice for which method to choose and cancels execution.  If the choice value input made by the user is an exceptable one, then it will automatically execute the method to sort the list in ascending order and display the unsorted list and then the sorted list for the user to verify.

I utilized the Sublime text editor and the Ubunta Commandline in order to compile this program by methods of creating a Makefile.  In order to compile this program correctly, then all of the files have to be copied into their own directory which I called mine "Lab4".  After this is done, then you have to make the "sort" file by typing <make> into the commandline.  Then by looking at the "Lab4" directory, you should have "sort" file which usually appears as a bright yellow directory.  In order to run this you must type  </.sort> and then <enter>.  In order to clean the file or to re-make the file, then you must type <make clean> in the same lab4 directory. This should clean the file for a new rebuild.  

Enclosed in "double-quotation marks" indicates a file or directory name.
Enclosed in <arrow operators tag structure> indicates buttons needed to be pressed by programmer or end-user.

Test data for the Input Values are: 7, 4, 2, 5, 25, 0, -3, 9, 45, -69.
Test data for the User Choice Input are: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
